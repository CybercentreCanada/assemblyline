## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the `Private vulnerability reporting` in the security tab to report a vulnerability in Assemblyline.
We take security very seriously and will address it as soon as possible.

**Note**: Vulnerabilities raised should take into context that Assemblyline is distributed as containerized software. Running the software without any containerization in a production scenario is outside of the expected use and guidelines mentioned in our [documentation](https://cybercentrecanada.github.io/assemblyline4_docs/installation/deployment/).

**Any report ignoring normal deployment procedures may be closed without warning by a member of the development team.**
